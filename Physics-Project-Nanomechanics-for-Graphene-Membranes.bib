@article{Lindsay2010,
abstract = {We have examined the commonly used Tersoff and Brenner empirical interatomic potentials in the context of the phonon dispersions in graphene. We have found a parameter set for each empirical potential that provides improved fits to some structural data and to the in-plane phonon dispersion data for graphite. These optimized parameter sets yield values of the acoustic phonon velocities that are in better agreement with measured data. They also provide lattice thermal conductivity values in single-walled carbon nanotubes that are considerably improved compared to those obtained from the original parameter sets.},

@article{Bai2010,
abstract = {Graphene has significant potential for application in electronics, but cannot be used for effective field-effect transistors operating at room temperature because it is a semimetal with a zero bandgap. Processing graphene sheets into nanoribbons with widths of less than 10 nm can open up a bandgap that is large enough for room-temperature transistor operation, but nanoribbon devices often have low driving currents or transconductances. Moreover, practical devices and circuits will require the production of dense arrays of ordered nanoribbons, which remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the production of a new graphene nanostructure--which we call a graphene nanomesh--that can open up a bandgap in a large sheet of graphene to create a semiconducting thin film. The nanomeshes are prepared using block copolymer lithography and can have variable periodicities and neck widths as low as 5 nm. Graphene nanomesh field-effect transistors can support currents nearly 100 times greater than individual graphene nanoribbon devices, and the on-off ratio, which is comparable with the values achieved in individual nanoribbon devices, can be tuned by varying the neck width. The block copolymer lithography approach used to make the nanomesh devices is intrinsically scalable and could allow for the rational design and fabrication of graphene-based devices and circuits with standard semiconductor processing.},

@article{Davidovikj2016,
abstract = {Membranes of suspended two-dimensional materials show a large variability in mechanical properties, in part due to static and dynamic wrinkles. As a consequence, experiments typically show a multitude of nanomechanical resonance peaks, which makes an unambiguous identification of the vibrational modes difficult. Here, we probe the motion of graphene nanodrum resonators with spatial resolution using a phase-sensitive interferometer. By simultaneously visualizing the local phase and amplitude of the driven motion, we show that unexplained spectral features represent split degenerate modes. When taking these into account, the resonance frequencies up to the eighth vibrational mode agree with theory. The corresponding displacement profiles however, are remarkably different from theory, as small imperfections increasingly deform the nodal lines for the higher modes. The Brownian motion, which is used to calibrate the local displacement, exhibits a similar mode pattern. The experiments clarify the complicated dynamic behaviour of suspended two-dimensional materials, which is crucial for reproducible fabrication and applications.},

@article{Zande2010,
abstract = {We fabricated large arrays of suspended, single-layer graphene membrane resonators using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth followed by patterning and transfer. We measure the resonators using both optical and electrical actuation and detection techniques. We find that the resonators can be modeled as flat membranes under tension, and that clamping the membranes on all sides improves agreement with our model and reduces the variation in frequency between identical resonators. The resonance frequency is tunable with both electrostatic gate voltage and temperature, and quality factors improve dramatically with cooling, reaching values up to 9000 at 10 K. These measurements show that it is possible to produce large arrays of CVD-grown graphene resonators with reproducible properties and the same excellent electrical and mechanical properties previously reported for exfoliated graphene.},
