Through our analysis of the both the clamped system and the two layer system we conclude that the membranes respond well to the frequencies at nano scale and that the atomic behaviour of the modes correlated with the findings of similar simulations on micro scale membranes. The response frequencies for modes at nano scale were found to be in the Terahertz spectrum, which further motivates experimental tests. Because of these findings it reasonable to believe that a nano device which uses the membranes as gates, can be created.
